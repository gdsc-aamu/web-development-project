# General Timeline (Weeks 1-2)

## Week 1-2: Project Setup & Design Completion

### Project Setup
- Initialize GitHub repository  
- Set up file structure for Frontend (React) and Backend (Node.js/Express)  
- Install dependencies and frameworks (React, Express, MongoDB, Firebase/Clerk)  

### Catching Up on Technologies
- Team familiarization with React, Node.js/Express, MongoDB, Firebase/Clerk  

### Task Assignments
- Define roles (Frontend, Backend, Database, Authentication, UI/UX)  
- Create a clear division of responsibilities and tasks  

### UI/UX Design
- Wireframe & mockups (Figma or Adobe XD)  
- Decide on branding (color palette, typography)  
- Finalize core pages: Home, Professor List, Review Form, Login/Signup

# Frontend Timeline (Weeks 3-10)

## Week 3-4: Authentication Integration & Basic Structure

### Authentication (Firebase/Clerk)
- Implement login/signup forms with React  
- Configure routing (e.g., React Router) to handle protected routes (Dashboard)  

### Page Layouts & Components
- Create basic layout components (Header, Footer, Navigation)  
- Set up a global state management approach (Redux or Context API)  

### Styling & Theming
- Begin applying design guidelines from Weeks 1-2  
- Ensure responsive design with CSS frameworks or styled components  

---

## Week 5-6: Review & Rating UI

### Review Submission UI
- Create forms for students to submit professor reviews  
- Implement rating controls (teaching style, difficulty, workload, etc.)  
- Validate input before submission  

### Review Display
- Show list of reviews on professor profile or a dedicated page  
- Organize review data in a user-friendly layout  

### State & Error Handling
- Manage form states and handle possible errors (e.g., rating out of range, required fields)  
- Display success/error messages  

---

## Week 7-8: Search & Filter Functionality

### Search Implementation
- Build search bar to find professors by name, course, or department  
- Show dynamic results as user types or on submit  

### Filtering & Sorting
- Allow users to filter by rating (difficulty, workload, etc.)  
- Provide sorting options (best-rated, most recent, etc.)  

### UI Polishing & Accessibility
- Enhance component styling for clarity and consistency  
- Add basic accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)  

---

## Week 9-10: Final Enhancements & Deployment

### Performance & Optimization
- Code splitting and lazy loading for heavy components (if needed)  
- Optimize images and assets  

### Final UI/UX Pass
- Conduct UI/UX testing, gather feedback, make final tweaks  
- Ensure mobile responsiveness is refined  

### Deployment (Frontend)
- Deploy to Vercel or Netlify  
- Configure environment variables (API endpoints, Firebase/Clerk keys)  
- Final check on domain and SSL certificate  

---

# Backend Timeline (Weeks 3-10)

## Week 3-4: Authentication & Database Setup

### User Authentication APIs
- Create routes for registration, login, logout  
- Integrate Firebase/Clerk tokens with Express middleware  

### Database Initialization
- Set up MongoDB (local or Atlas)  
- Define schema for Users, Professors, Reviews  
- Configure indexing and relationships (User ↔ Review, Professor ↔ Review)  

---

## Week 5-6: Review Management

### Review Endpoints
- Create RESTful APIs to add, update, and delete reviews  
- Validate user permissions (only author can edit/delete their review)  

### Ratings & Aggregation
- Implement logic to calculate average ratings for each professor  
- Store rating stats (teaching style, difficulty, workload)  

### Security Considerations
- Input validation (e.g., sanitize text, check rating limits)  
- Rate limiting or basic throttling to prevent spam  

---

## Week 7-8: Search & Filter APIs

### Search by Query Parameters
- `GET /professors?name=Smith` or `GET /professors?department=CS`  
- Handle combined filters (department + rating range)  

### Advanced Filtering & Sorting
- Allow sorting by average rating, number of reviews, or name  
- Optimize queries (indexes on frequently searched fields)  

### Pagination
- Return paginated results to manage large data sets  
- Provide total counts, next/previous page links  

---

## Week 9-10: Performance, Testing & Deployment

### Performance Tuning
- Query optimization, indexing checks, caching if needed  
- Optimize server configuration for Express  

### Integration & Unit Testing
- Use frameworks like Jest/Mocha for testing routes and database logic  
- Confirm that API endpoints function correctly (CRUD reviews, searching, etc.)  

### Deployment (Backend)
- Deploy to Heroku, Render, or AWS  
- Secure environment variables (DB connection strings, API keys)  
- Set up continuous integration (CI/CD) for automated builds/tests
